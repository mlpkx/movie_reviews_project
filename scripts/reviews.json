        "reviewText": "Mina Shum's Double Happiness bravely explores a group that mainstream film (read: Hollywood) continues to ignore: Asians in North America. That the film features strong acting, good writing and confident direction makes its accomplishments all the more greater. You don't need to be Asian to enjoy this film, anymore than you have to be Italian to watch The Godfathers. Young women of whatever ethnic backgrounds are bound to identify with the lead character, finely played by Sandra Oh. The daughter-father conflict crosses all national boundaries, and is explored in this film through the eyes of Chinese-Canadians. I'm a Canadian of Chinese descent, and found the characterizations of the family to be accurate overall. At times, the domineering Father is one-dimensional (tyrannical and cold) and needed to be fleshed out more. The role of the siblings--especially towards their parents--was underplayed and could have offered a contrast to the main relationship between the elder daughter and Dad. Still, the strict traditionalism of the parents was on the nose, and the struggles of the daughter, Jade, ring true. In fact, I venture to say that Jade was played *too* obediently, and should have broken from her family sooner. Following this line of thought, the film could have been expanded to explore Jade moving into her own home and finding her own career as an actress, then reconciling (perhaps) with her stern Father at the end. As it stands, the movie ends abruptly and too soon. Shum and Oh do a fine job of getting Jade on the audience's side, only pull the carpet on her just as she leaves home. The movie begs for closure in the relationship between daughter and father. Perhaps in the sequel.",

        "reviewText": "Mina Shum wrote and directed this story of a Chinese-Canadian family in Vancouver with the central character being Jade (Sandra Oh). Jade's father Quo (Stephen Chang) is very strict about his children following old Chinese traditions and if they don't then they are disowned by him. So Jade actually tries to live two separate lives, one an obedient daughter who goes along with her fathers wishes (For the most part) and when she is out with her friends she can be a normal woman in her early 20's who talk about boys and goes to clubs. Jade wants to be an actress much to the chagrin of her parents and she goes out on auditions. One night she meets a man named Mark who is white and they have a one night stand. Jade's parents do not know him at first and fix her up on dates with Chinese men. They're is some excellent visual imagery in the film and in one scene Jade and Mark are on swings and the shot is in slow motion with a good and effective musical score to enhance the visual flair. In another scene a fed up Jade gets out of the car of another date and starts to run down the street. We are not told where she is running to but we must assume its to Mark. Sandra Oh's performance seems to be flawless. Watching her character ultimately give up trying to please her father is just riveting to watch. I've always been a big fan of Oh's and I thought she was equally terrific in 'Dancing at the Blue Iguana'. Oh takes the character of Jade and makes her not only smart and strong, but makes her very human also! When a casting director asks her how could she possibly think of herself as Chinese if she cannot read it, Jade at this point in the film questions herself and ultimately comes to a life changing decision. Mina Shums script is sharp and she doesn't portray Jade's parents as one dimensional. They have issues as well and it affects the lives of their children. Well written script gives Oh the opportunity to give a totally convincing and haunting performance.",

        "reviewText": "I recently saw a list and short synopses of the screenplays accepted for the Sundance Screenwriters Lab. In short the overall subject matter seemed to be death, doom and depression, i.e. serious subjects for serious films. I am sure that many good and possibly some great scripts and films will come out of the program.Comedy is hard. Really hard. Okay, I'm willing to concede that teenage gross out bathroom humor movies probably aren't too difficult, and don't get me wrong I enjoy a good gastro-intestinal joke as much as the next person, but a movie that makes you laugh (a lot), touches your heart and just plain makes you feel good... well I think that is something quite rare -- especially these days.Saving Face is one of the funniest, warmest, most heartfelt movies I have seen in a long, long time. Its a smart, insightful movie for adults. And like any really really good romantic comedy it is about much more than what is on the surface. I really don't care that it is Alice Wu's first film (although that makes her accomplishment all the more extraordinary) -- all I care about is that it isn't her last.",

        "reviewText": "I was fortunate to see the World premier at the Toronto Film Festival. It was an almost finished product with only some minor changes still needing to be done (mostly tweaking the temporary score and sound) but I didn't notice that it wasn't a finished product. Saving Face is a funny film by written and directed by first time director: Alice Wu. It is about a widow (Joan Chen) who is in her late-40's and has a daughter who is a surgeon. She tries to set up her daughter at these Chinese dances that happen once a week but the daughter is not interested. One day the woman shows up on the daughter's doorstep, kicked out of her home because she has brought shame to the family by becoming pregnant out of wedlock. The mother and daughter have to adjust while the daughter tries to hide her lesbian relationship with her boss's daughter. I liked this film. Joan Chen was very funny in this film. The comedy is good, a nice light touch and on a level everyone can relate too. Although, the fact they are Chinese is not glossed over. The dramatic scenes were weaker in contrast to the comedy but still worked. The three main actresses were good although Joan Chen was the star. If you liked What's Cooking or Mambo Italiano or My Big Fat Greek Wedding, then I think you will like this movie. I am Asian but not Chinese so I do have my biases. Having said that, I think that this film will help break the typical Asian stereotype and will be a mainstream success. Apparently Sony pictures has bought the distribution rights so I expect to see it in theatre some time next year. I give it an 8/10. Definitely worth a look if you want a nice light comedy with a little drama. Note the film is half in Mandarin and half in English but there are English subtitles. I will definitely see it again when it comes out in general release and I will buy the DVD when it comes out.",

        "reviewText": "Absolutely delightful. An American-Born-Chinese lesbian finds her world rocked when her widowed mother is disowned for getting pregnant out of wedlock. The story subverts stereotypes about race, gender, sexuality, and age, but it never seems to do too much. Enough time is spent on major and minor characters and plots. The end teeters on Joy Luck Club-level saccharine, but the performances are all nuanced and the bilingual script is seamless in mixing the elders' traditional Mandarin and the ABCs' mix of English and broken Mandarin. There is the requisite nagging Tiger Mom we've come to expect from Asian culture clash films, but Joan Chen brings a quieter, more sensual layer as well, since Ma is also back on the market. Michelle Krusiec, as the surgeon daughter, is brilliantly still and funny in a serious way. There are even a few mannerisms of hers that I know I do/did in my one short film acting experience. She, along with Carey Mulligan and Emmanuelle BÃ©art, are actresses whose faces I'd like to wear, 'Silence-of-the-Lambs'-style.",

        "reviewText": "I first saw this film some years ago on tv and it became my mission to own the dvd because my grandmother herself was one such Japanese picture bride. It helped tell her story, a story that my mother, aunts and uncles were unwilling to impart on their children of their motherâs experiences. Because of my personal connection to this story I decided to read through all the reviews to help keep an objective perspective when writing my review. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of majority of positive reviews especially since almost all the reviewers had no knowledge Japanese picture brides. The few criticisms were confined to production value that comes with the territory of being a low budget independent film, to whether a certain actor was the best choice for a part or only touching superficially on the complexity of the side plots, like worker conditions in the fields. Itâs a shame that Picture Bride couldnât have been made into a 2-3 part miniseries and delve in greater depth into these side plots like the complicated and intricate matchmaking process, the worker conditions and pay hierarchy based on ethnicity, to the widespread drinking and gambling that inflicted many of the husbands, or the injustice of having all their personal reminders, letters, pictures, wedding dresses and etc. of their families and ties to Japan confiscated by the FBI after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the indignity of not being allowed to become US citizens until the mid 1950âs when Federal law was changed allowing immigrant Asians to naturalize. These are the things these women endured during their lifetimes. Let me say this movie is a tribute to these incredible young women, of ages 17-20 years old who before leaving home married a man only known in a picture and to journeyed thousands of miles to be his wife and the mother of his children in a foreign land where she doesnât know the language and work at a job she had no training or prior skills to perform, (the 1905 Gentlemanâs Agreement disallowed the issuance of new labor worker visas from Japan but allowed already visa workers and their families to come to the US; hence the picture bride phenomenon). Think of the incredible bravery it took for them to make the journey and the equally incredible strength they would exhibit to make the best out of their situation. Just imagine yourself doing what they did today and I think anyone can appreciate their story. Despite some of its shortcomings, (Director Kayo Hatta discusses these shortcoming on the directorâs commentary), and after learning some details of my own grandmotherâs experiences, I can say itâs very much authentic. How authentic? After describing the storyline to my mother, she refuses to watch it because it will bring back too many memories of her childhood and the sadness she felt for how her mother had to live. My mother has told me how her mother waited on the docks of Honolulu until there was only her and one man left, soon coming to the disheartening realization that he must be her husband and if she had the money she would have gotten back on board and returned to Japan. My aunt has told me how my grandmotherâs friends, just before she left Japan, were so excited for her going on this âadventure.â Looking at a picture of my grandmother in Japan and another one a year after she arrived in Hawaii, she looks so small and delicate (one of the criticisms of using Youki Kudoh as Riyo, that she didnât match the part - to prim and proper) and then a photo years later, the toll of her after years of toiling in the fields during the day, doing laundry at night then on the weekends ironing clothes from sunup to late into the night, I easily recognize the characters Riyo as before and Kana as after in those pictures. All in all, Kayo Hattaâs Picture Bride is an amazing tribute these women and their stories. Films like Picture Bride, Come See the Paradise, Farewell to Manzanar (only read the book), Snow Falling on Cedars, and American Pastime are treasures that sadly go relatively unnoticed. Theyâre important for they not only expose Americans to Japanese-American (Nikkei) history, they more importantly expose Nikkei history to third and fourth generation Japanese-Americans who have âlostâ their history because the older generationâs reluctance to tell their story.",

        "reviewText": "In Between Days is an independent film directed by So Yong Kim. It won few awards, including a Special Jury Prize from Sundance Film Festival. The film was completed by 2006. It was set somewhere in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It stars Jiseon Kim, Taegu Andy Kang and Gina Kim. Languages used in the film are Korean and English. It runs for 83 minutes. In Between Days is a coming of age film about Aimie (Jiseon Kim), a Korean immigrant. Aimie and her mother just moved to Canada. She has trouble adjusting. Everything she has, she left in South Korea. She's not exactly good at school. She has an awkward relationship with her mother. Despite her father leaving her mother, Aimie is still longing for her father. The only person she relies to is Tran, her best friend. For Aimie, Tran isn't just a friend. But Tran doesn't seem to see her the way she sees him. Aimie's life started becoming complicated when her mother started going on dates and when Tran hangs out with other girls.The film started pretty depressing, the mood is too. It was fairly likable, though. I love the cinematography and Aimie's monologues. The trademark of the film is the bridge. Aimie and Tran always cross the bridge. It kind of become the part of the story. I think it was intentional. Ha-Ha. Aimie and her mother has an awkward relationship, as I mentioned before. It's like they are there for each other because, who else will they lean on to? Although, there are times when Aimie's mother shows affection for her. But Aimie seems too attached to her life back in Korea. In the end, Aimie just seems to roll with it instead of waiting for her mother to drag her back to Korea.Tran, Aimie's best friend, helps her with studying English. Aimie just doodles when they study. They have this cute friendship that makes you aww they would look good as a couple. But you know it will never work out. I think the reason why Tran detaches himself, sometime in the film, is because he wants to make other friends...or to find a girlfriend. He keeps dragging Aimie to parties but Aimie is in this perfect bubble where she thinks she's going back to Korea soon and she can bring Tran along with her and they can live happily ever after. No, Aimie stop dreaming!In Between Days doesn't really have a solid ending. Because life's ending is death. I like that it doesn't have one. It will make me conclude of my own ending for Aimie's story. I could make hundreds of them. The film could be boring for a lot of people because it doesn't have a lot of dialogue. But that's how most indie films are. They're slow and focuses a lot on cinematography; the film has a lot of that. It also has a lot of emotions. It just depends what gets into you.",

Also, choosing Sandra Oh, a Korean actress to be a child of both Cantonese speaking parents just leave a big sour taste to my mouth.

This is a theme we have seen before, but this cast creates a thoughtful and enjoyable movie. This family has the predictable stern father and unquestioningly obedient mother, on the surface, but the film maker is able to get through the outside shell and show them as people with thier own fears and concerns. Sandra Oh, as Jade Li, gives her character real personality as she struggles to break into the world of acting. Not only is she a Chinese woman breaking into a western film but there are problems with her even making it into a Chinese film. Her family are desperate for her to settle down and get married and become a responsible child, but Jade isn't ready yet. There are a few plot twists as arranged matches go off the rails in her parents quest for her. Jade makes her own decisions as to romance and this leads to problems. This is not a story of love triumphing over adversity. It is a story of love and adversity living side by side. It does not have a romantic conclusion but ends on a thoughtful and wondering note. This is not The Brady Bunch with subtitles. The casting for this film was excellent. The cast works well together and is quite believeable. The setting is also excellent. I was able to get more invovled with the film as I recognized some of the sites in the film from previous stays in Vancouver, BC. So for me, this was an advantage in appreciating the film. Over all, this is a well made film that works well. It is a pleasure to watch. I recommend it to all.",
